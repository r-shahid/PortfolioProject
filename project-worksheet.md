## Project Description

My portfolio website will include a short bio, links to all my projects, and a contact form. The layout I have in mind will highlight my best/favorite project while showing recent projects in a carousel. I'm inspired by blogs like [EggCanvas](https://www.eggcanvas.com/) and my friend's [personal website](https://www.isabelcalkins.com/). I find their layouts really appealing and modern, which I hope to embody in this project. I'm also taking elements from [my own website](https://rianashahid.com/about), which was created on pre-bulit templates that don't require much coding knowledge. I'm not at a place where I can recreate the entire site from scratch, but I really like the layout I have on my About page, so I plan on doing something similar for my Desktop version. 

## Google Sheet

## Wireframes

* [Mobile](https://i.imgur.com/RDNHl1k.png)

 A single-column layout with projects at the top and a long bio and contact form at the bottom. Menu shows as a hamburger icon and clicking each section scrolls down the page.

* [Tablet](https://i.imgur.com/DPxS9z3.png)

 Similar to the Mobile version, projects are at the top and a bio and contact form are at the bottom of the page. Projects displayed in two columns and full nav bar instead of a hamburger icon.

 Unlike the other two versions, my bio is at the top. I felt this would be more appropriate for desktop because it's easier for users to scroll down to get to the projects. On a smaller screen, where users will probably spend less time per page, it's better to have projects at the top, to make sure viewers will see it.
